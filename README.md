# Ralph Baer's "Brown Box" prototype

## Ralph Baer created a series of [TV game prototypes](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/the-father-of-the-video-game-the-ralph-baer-prototypes-and-electronic-games) in the 1960s, that led to the first commercial TV game console, the [Magnavox Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey). This github is for files related to the the ["Brown Box"](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1301997) - the last prototype that was created and resides in the Smithsonian.

## Goals
1. We would like to create a **functional PCB version** of the Brown Box, which can be populated by modern (or vintage) transistors

1. We have reason to believe the "build to print" Brown Box, and the actual artifact, are *__somewhat different__*.  We want to understand these differences, as well as the differences between the "brown box" and the eventual manufactured Magnavox Odyssey console.

## Contents

The current KiCAD schematic and PCB layout is based on this original schematic, which is the best copy "available" on the Smithsonian website.

### The KiCAD schematic is mostly complete!

### The KiCAD PCB is just getting started
